          <h2>Capture and Share the World's Moments</h2>
          <p>
            Instagram is a fast, beautiful and fun way to share your life with
            friends and family. <br />
            Take a picture or video, choose a filter to transform its look and
            feel, then post to Instagram &mdash; it's that easy. You can even
            share to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and more. It's a new way to see
            the world.
            <br />
            Oh yeah, did we mention it's free?
